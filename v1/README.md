# Aggregate-Map-2-proportion-flooded-and-average-depth
Aggregates a inundation raster (where no inundation is given by the NoData/NoValue value for the raster), by calculating the proportion of the input map that is flooded by each cell in the larger grid, and the average depth of inundation across the portion that is inundated

Code orginally developed for the DSS project funded by the Bushfire and Natural Hazards CRC.
